Observations:
Specimen continues to exhibit notable fear or aversion toward offered prey items. On 2025-08-09, a deceased 
cricket was placed within the burrow. As of today, the specimen has not consumed it and is maintaining 
avoidance behavior toward the food source. However, during the night the cricket was repositioned within 
the enclosure, suggesting the specimen interacted with it but did not feed.

The specimen was also observed taking a drink from its water dish during the observation period, indicating 
normal hydration behavior despite reduced feeding interest. No predatory or full investigative feeding 
response was noted. The lack of feeding may be associated with stress, pre-molt behavior, or other 
physiological factors, though temperature and humidity remain within the species’ acceptable range.

Notes:
	•	Continue monitoring for pre-molt indicators or other behavioral triggers for feeding cessation.
	•	Uneaten prey should be removed within 24–48 hours to avoid attracting mites or other detritivores.
	•	Hydration behavior appears normal.
