# Initial Observation — Neoholothele incei (Trinidad Olive)

**Specimen ID:** NI-01  
**Acquisition Date:** 2025-08-09  
**Source:**Petco 
**Condition at Acquisition:** Suboptimal — small abdomen, hesitant with prey response, limited webbing behavior, but energetic and mobile.

## Notes
- Specimen appears alert and capable of movement across enclosure.
- Abdomen size suggests either recent molt with insufficient feeding or prolonged low nutrition.
- Exhibits food avoidance — may be stress-related, environmental, or due to past feeding methods.
- Webbing behavior is minimal compared to expected baseline for the species.

## Hypotheses
1. **Stress-Induced Feeding Avoidance:** Environmental change or previous husbandry stress may suppress normal feeding behavior.
2. **Nutritional Deficit Recovery:** Limited abdomen size may lead to prioritization of movement over web construction until nutritional status improves.
3. **Inadequate Web Anchoring Opportunities:** Enclosure setup at store or currently may not encourage normal webbing behavior.
4. **Prey-Type Preference:** Specimen may have a feeding preference not yet identified (roach vs cricket vs mealworm).
5. **Behavioral Individuality:** This individual may deviate from typical species norms for web construction.

## Questions for Ongoing Study
- Will prey acceptance improve after a settling-in period?
- How long until abdomen size increases to a healthy proportion?
- Does webbing behavior increase with nutritional recovery?
- Will environmental enrichment (more anchor points, hides) stimulate web-building?
- Does prey type, size, or delivery method affect feeding response?
- How does behavior compare to the next specimen (NI-02) once acquired?
